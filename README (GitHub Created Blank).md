# React_Router

***INITIAL SET-UP After Installation of the React App***

#1 Create the REACT APP with the installation line "npx create-react-app react_router". The last part of the installation line is actually the name of the folder that will be created where the React Install files will be.

#2 Delete the un-necessary files installed by the React Installation: App.test.js; logo.svg and setupTests.js. Remove the 'import logo' from App.js

#3 Remove all the default-css from App.css file. Also include code at the top of index.css to remove all the preset margins from default installation

***MAIN PART of the Tutorial***

#4 Create various components in a component folder

#5 Install 'npm i react-router-dom' in the main folder

#6 For some of the components, you can clean up the code by using <> instead of <div>.

#7 Wrap the entire high-level-App in <BrowserRouter> and make sure to import it from 'react-router-dom'
